# Code Structure for Neural Network Implementation

## Overview
The implementation can be structured by starting with a `Neuron` class, then creating a collection of `Neuron` objects as a `Layer`, and finally a collection of `Layer` objects as a `Network`. Each `Neuron` has associated weights and biases.

### Neuron Class
**Purpose:** Represents a single neuron in the neural network.

**Attributes:**
- Weights: A list or array of weights associated with the inputs to the neuron.
- Bias: A single bias value added to the neuron's weighted sum of inputs.

**Methods:**
- Initialization: Set initial small random values for weights and bias.
- Forward Pass: Calculate the neuron's output by performing a weighted sum of inputs, adding the bias, and applying an activation function.
- Activation Function: Apply a non-linear function (e.g., sigmoid) to the neuron's input to produce its output.
- Derivative of Activation Function: Compute the derivative of the activation function for backpropagation.

### Layer Class
**Purpose:** Represents a layer of neurons in the neural network.

**Attributes:**
- Neurons: A collection (e.g., list) of `Neuron` objects in the layer.

**Methods:**
- Initialization: Create a specified number of neurons, each with weights and biases initialized.
- Forward Pass: Compute the outputs for all neurons in the layer by passing the inputs through each neuron.
- Backward Pass: Calculate and propagate errors backward through the layer for updating weights and biases (placeholder for later implementation).

### Network Class
**Purpose:** Represents the entire neural network, composed of multiple layers.

**Attributes:**
- Layers: A collection (e.g., list) of `Layer` objects in the network.

**Methods:**
- Initialization: Define the network architecture (number of layers and neurons per layer) and initialize the layers accordingly.
- Forward Pass: Sequentially pass inputs through each layer to produce the network's output.
- Backward Pass: Propagate errors backward through the network to update all weights and biases (placeholder for later implementation).
- Training: Implement a loop to train the network over multiple epochs, adjusting weights and biases based on the error computed from the network's predictions.
- Prediction: Use the forward pass to generate predictions from new input data.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Architecture:**
   - Decide on the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer based on the problem you are solving.
   - Example Architecture:
     - Input Layer: 2 neurons (for 2 input features)
     - Hidden Layer: 3 neurons
     - Output Layer: 1 neuron

2. **Initialize Weights and Biases:**
   - Create a weight matrix for each layer, initialized with small random values.
   - Ensure the dimensions of the weight matrices align with the architecture of the network.
   - Create a bias vector for each layer, initialized with small random values.
   - Ensure the length of each bias vector matches the number of neurons in the respective layer.

3. **Forward Propagation:**
   - Implement the forward pass to compute the output of the network by passing inputs through each layer and neuron.

4. **Backpropagation (Placeholder):**
   - Plan the implementation of the backward pass to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias, and update them to minimize the loss.

5. **Training Loop:**
   - Create a loop to iteratively train the network by performing forward and backward passes, and updating the weights and biases using gradient descent.

6. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Validate the network by testing it with new data, observing its performance, and making necessary adjustments to improve accuracy and efficiency.
