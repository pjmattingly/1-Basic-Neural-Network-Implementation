# Step 1: Initialize the Network

## Objective
Define the architecture of the neural network, including the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer, and initialize the weights and biases for each neuron.

### Define the Architecture
1. **Number of Layers:**
   - Decide the overall structure of your neural network.
   - At a minimum, your network should include:
     - **Input Layer:** The initial layer that receives the input features.
     - **Hidden Layers:** One or more layers where computations happen.
     - **Output Layer:** The final layer that produces the output.

2. **Number of Neurons per Layer:**
   - **Input Layer:** Typically, the number of neurons equals the number of input features.
   - **Hidden Layers:** The number of neurons can vary; common choices depend on the problem complexity.
   - **Output Layer:** The number of neurons depends on the output requirements (e.g., one neuron for binary classification).

### Initialize Weights and Biases
1. **Weights:**
   - Weights are parameters that transform input data within the network.
   - Initialize weights to small random values to break symmetry and allow the network to learn effectively.
   - The dimensions of the weight matrix for a layer with `n` inputs and `m` outputs will be `(n, m)`.

2. **Biases:**
   - Biases are additional parameters added to the weighted sum of inputs in a neuron.
   - Each neuron has an associated bias, initialized to a small random value.
   - The length of the bias vector should match the number of neurons in the respective layer.

### Steps to Initialize the Network
1. **Define the Number of Layers and Neurons:**
   - Decide on the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer based on the problem you are solving.
   - Example Architecture:
     - Input Layer: 2 neurons (for 2 input features)
     - Hidden Layer: 3 neurons
     - Output Layer: 1 neuron

2. **Initialize Weights:**
   - Create a weight matrix for each layer, initialized with small random values.
   - Ensure the dimensions of the weight matrices align with the architecture of the network.
   - Example Weight Matrices:
     - Weight matrix from input layer to hidden layer: `2 x 3`
     - Weight matrix from hidden layer to output layer: `3 x 1`

3. **Initialize Biases:**
   - Create a bias vector for each layer, initialized with small random values.
   - Ensure the length of each bias vector matches the number of neurons in the respective layer.
   - Example Bias Vectors:
     - Bias vector for hidden layer: length 3
     - Bias vector for output layer: length 1

### Practical Tips
- **Random Initialization:** Using small random values helps break symmetry and facilitates effective learning.
- **Layer Dimensions:** Carefully manage the dimensions of weight matrices and bias vectors to ensure they align correctly with the network architecture.
- **Reproducibility:** Set a random seed for the random number generator if you want reproducible results.
