# Basic Neural Network Implementation

## Objective
Understand the fundamentals of neural networks by building a simple feedforward neural network from scratch. This will involve learning about key concepts such as backpropagation, gradient descent, and activation functions.

## Project
Implement a simple feedforward neural network using only Python and NumPy.

## Skills Learned
Backpropagation, gradient descent, activation functions.

## Technologies
Pure Python, NumPy.

## Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. Understand the Basics of Neural Networks
- Learn the structure of neural networks, which includes layers of neurons (input layer, hidden layers, and output layer).
- Understand the roles of weights and biases in the network.

### 2. Mathematical Foundations
- **Forward Pass:** Calculate the output of the neural network by propagating inputs through the network.
- **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity using functions like sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU.
- **Loss Function:** Measure the difference between the predicted output and the actual output using functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy Loss.
- **Backward Pass (Backpropagation):** Update the weights and biases based on the gradient of the loss function.
- **Gradient Descent:** Minimize the loss function by iteratively updating the weights and biases.

### 3. Implementation Steps
1. **Initialize the Network:**
   - Define the architecture (number of layers, number of neurons per layer) and initialize weights and biases.
2. **Define Activation Functions:**
   - Implement common activation functions and their derivatives.
3. **Forward Pass:**
   - Implement the process of calculating the network's output.
4. **Compute Loss:**
   - Implement the loss function to evaluate the network's performance.
5. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation):**
   - Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias, and update them accordingly.
6. **Training Loop:**
   - Create a loop to iteratively perform the forward pass, compute loss, perform backpropagation, and update weights. Train the network on a sample dataset.

### 4. Experimentation and Learning
- Experiment with different activation functions, learning rates, and network architectures.
- Observe how changes affect the network's performance and learning rate.
